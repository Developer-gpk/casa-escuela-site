        incorporate the basis on which bookings for Alma Maya LLC, Alma Maya S

        Conditions for your reservation. By using this site, you agree to be
        bound by these Terms and Conditions. We may revise these Terms and
        Conditions from time to time by updating this posting. The revised terms
        will take effect when they are posted. Your use of some parts or
        features of the site may be governed by additional Terms and Conditions.
        Where this is the case you will be notified accordingly of those
        additional Terms and Conditions.
        <div className="terms-title">Early Check-Out</div>
        The property reserves the right to charge an early departure fee in the
        event a guest departs earlier than the original departure date.
        <div className="terms-title">Late Check-Out</div>
        On request. Please contact the front office of each property. Additional
        fees may apply.
        <div className="terms-title">Guarantee Policy</div>A valid credit card
        is required at booking time. The credit card used at the time of booking
        must be presented by the guest together with positive identification
        upon check-in at the property. An imprint or swipe of the card will be
        taken upon check-in. Upon departure from the property, all fees for
        services rendered shall be payable by the guest and where necessary the
        credit card will be debited by the property for the fees. The property
        shall debit the credit card for all cancellations, no shows or for any
        damages caused by the guest to the property howsoever arising. This
        transaction constitutes an electronic transaction and a binding
        agreement in terms of which the guest authorizes the property to debit
        the credit card as stated above and the guest&#39;s written signature
        shall not be required for authorisation purposes.
        <div className="terms-title">Deposit Policy</div>A deposit may be
        required.
        <div className="terms-title">Cancellation Policy</div>
        Each rate booked at a Alma Maya Resort property is subject to a
        Cancellation Policy. Failure to check in on the reserved arrival date
        will incur a penalty charge as detailed in the Cancellation Policy of
        the rate booked. We reserve the right to cancel or modify reservations
        under the circumstances where it appears that a customer has provided an
        invalid credit card, engaged in fraudulent or inappropriate activity, or
        the reservation contains or resulted from a mistake or error. In
        addition, we also reserve the right to cancel or amend bookings if they
        do not adhere to our Terms and Conditions. If a guest chooses to shorten
        their stay or check out early, a penalty charge will apply, as detailed
        in the Cancellation Policy associated with the rate booked. In the cases
        of the aforementioned booking cancellations, Alma Maya Resort has no
        obligation to guarantee new available bookings or best rates. A new
        booking at the best available rate will need to be made by the guest at
        the time of the new reservation. As a condition of using this website,
        you agree to provide proof of payment to the hotel reservations
        department within 48 hours of the time of booking and will indicate the
        reservation confirmation number on the proof of payment. You will be
        fully responsible for any banking fees and/or costs required to complete
        the bank fund transaction(s). Furthermore, you acknowledge that the
        reservation may be canceled by the hotel if proof of payment is not
        submitted to the hotel within the 48-hour notice period. You will be
        responsible for any cancellation or no show penalties that might be
        incurred and hereby acknowledge that booking and personal contact
        information provided is correct for the hotel&#39;s validation purposes.
        <div className="terms-title">Pricing Errors</div>
        Alma Maya Resort and its affiliates reserve the right to cancel
        contracts based upon incorrect information being displayed in relation
        to price or service at any point in time.
        <div className="terms-title">Foreign Currency</div>
        Only the currency confirmed within your reservation is confirmed.
        <div className="terms-title">Relocation</div>
        In the rare unexpected event whereby the property cannot provide
        accommodation as previously confirmed, the property will comply with its
        standard of obligation by undertaking to relocate guests into an
        alternative property within Alma Maya Resort of equal or better grading
        at no expense to the guest. Should there not be a property of equal or
        better grading in the vicinity of the original booking, it may be
        required to provide guests with a property of a lesser grading. If this
        is the case, any reduction in costs will be refunded to the guest. The
        alternatives offered are at the property&#39;s discretion. Should the
        guest wish to choose a property of a standard other than offered under
        this condition, then the guest will be required to pay any difference.
