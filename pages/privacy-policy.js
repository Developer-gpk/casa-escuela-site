        <div className="privacy-title">Your rights</div>
        Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data.
        Request access to your personal data
        Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a &#34;data subject access request&#34;). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
        Request correction of your personal data
        Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.

        Request erasure of your personal data
        Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

        Object to processing of your personal data
        Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.

        Request restriction of processing your personal data
        Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: 
        If you want us to establish the data&#39;s accuracy.
        Where our use of the data is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it.
        Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims. 
        You have objected to our use of your data, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. 
        Request transfer of your personal data
        Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you. 

        Right to withdraw consent
        Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
        If you no longer want to receive marketing-related emails, you may opt out by visiting our [unsubscribe page] or by following the instructions in any email you receive from us.
        <div className="privacy-title">Contact Us</div>
        If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us. 
        Email: info@almamayaresort.com; or 
        Post: 11520 SW 22nd Ct Davie, FL 33325. 
        Under certain circumstances where applicable law permits, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with a competent data protection supervisory authority.
        <div className="privacy-title">What we may need from you</div>
        
        We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
        You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable administration fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances and we will indicate the reason for refusal.
        <div className="privacy-title">Time limit to respond</div>
        
        We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month or within the timeframe as specified by the applicable data protection legislation. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated. 
        <div className="privacy-title">Data security</div>
        We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions, and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
        
        We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
